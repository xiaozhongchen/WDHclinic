	<div class="panel"> 
	<p>The Canadian Dental Association (CDA) recommends that you get a dental exam and cleaning at least every six months. However, the frequency of your dental visits depends on several factors, including: 
<ul><li>Oral health: If you're prone to gum disease or cavities, you may need to see your dentist more often. For example, people with gum disease often see their dentist every three to four months. 
</li><li>Age: Your age may be a factor in how often you should visit the dentist. 
</li><li>Risk factors: Other risk factors may also affect how often you should visit the dentist.</li>
</ul> 
In addition to regular dental cleanings, you should also: 
<ul><li>Brush your teeth at least twice a day or after every meal 
</li><li>Floss at least once a day or after every meal 
</li><li>Maintain good oral hygiene to keep germs under control</li></ul> 
You should also talk to your dentist if you develop any new or concerning symptoms, such as: toothache, bleeding gums, and loose teeth.</p>

	<button class="accordion">Am I eligible for Canada Dental Care Plan?</button>
	<div class="panel">
	<p>The Canada Dental Care Plan (CDCP) is a federal initiative aimed at providing dental coverage to Canadians who lack access to private insurance. The eligibility criteria for the CDCP are outlined to help low- and middle-income families access dental care. Here's a breakdown of who is eligible:

<h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<h4>1.Income Threshold:</h4>

Individuals or families with an annual income below a certain threshold. The threshold is typically adjusted for family size and economic conditions, with lower-income households prioritized.

<h4>2.Lack of Private Insurance:</h4>

<ul><li>Those who do not have access to private dental insurance.</li>
<li>Individuals covered under public programs may have partial eligibility, depending on overlap with provincial plans.</li></ul>

<h4>3.Age and Demographics:</h4>
<ul><li>
Initial phases focus on children under 12 years old (as of 2022-2023).</li>
<li>Expansion to include teenagers under 18, seniors, and persons with disabilities is planned in subsequent phases.</li></ul>

<h4>4.Tax and Residency Requirements:</h4>

Must be a resident of Canada and have filed a recent income tax return to confirm income eligibility.
<h4>5.No Duplication with Provincial Plans:</h4>

The plan does not replace existing provincial dental coverage. It acts as a supplementary measure for services not covered by provincial or territorial programs.
<h3>What Is Covered?</h3>
The plan typically includes:
<ul><li>
Basic dental services: cleanings, fillings, and x-rays.</li>
<li>Preventive care.</li>
<li>Emergency procedures.</li></ul>

<h3>How to Apply:</h3>
<ul><li>Applications are processed through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</li>
<li>Proof of income and lack of insurance may be required during the application process.</li></ul>
